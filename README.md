# PracticalMalwareAnalysisLabProblems
A collection of IDA Pro Reverse Engineering Databases for the Lab Problems in Practical Malware Analysis by Michael Sikorski and Andrew Honig.

Some units/labs are missing due to IDA Pro not saving some databases properly and because of data corruption caused by a paranoid anti-virus program.

# Binaries
The binaries that were reversed for these problems can be found [here](https://github.com/mikesiko/PracticalMalwareAnalysis-Labs).
